# coldwaters-modding
Minor tweaks to suit my preferences.

## Installing

Just to use the mod, download the zip and extract the contents to this directory in your Cold Waters install folder.

    ColdWaters_Data/StreamingAssets/override

If you're going to be working on the mod, cd into the `StreamingAssets` directory and clone the repo.
Rename the resulting `coldwaters-modding` folder to `override`.

## Changes

* Changed the default controls to my preferred layout.
    - W/X for planes up/down. *More consistent IMO with Q/Z and E/C.*
    - S for level out. *Nice and central.*
    - Shift-F for noisemaker. *Too easy to accidentally hit Shift-D.*
    - Numpad 8/2 for torpedo up/down *Consistent with W/X.*
* Changed the hud layout to have all controls visible above the mini map.
* Made the later Los Angeles class variants available in the 1984 campaign. *It's kinda cheating I know, but I really like having VLS.*
* Removed TLAMs from default Los Angeles Flt 3 and Seawolf loadouts. *They're useless in combat, you always have enough time to return to base when given a land strike, and I think having 8 of them makes the game think you have enough weapons and not give you the return to base prompt when it otherwise would.*
* Modified Difficulty Settings.
    - Campaign: Easy and Normal are now basically identical, with Hard and Elite being slightly more difficult. *I found the Easy campaign to be too short to be interesting, but didn't like the reload and time in port penalties applied on harder difficulties.*
    - Combat: Enemy ships now get more hull points across the board, and the player gets less on Easy and Normal. *Having a single harpoon take out almost any surface ship made Tomahawks useless. Likewise for every sub besides the Typhoon being a one-hit-kill.*
* WIP: 1989 Campaign.
    - Essentially the 1984 campaign with some tweaks.
    - Added Los Angeles flt 2/3 and Seawolf.
    - Increased possible count of SSGNs and SSBNs in their respective missions. *Knowing there would always just be one target ship in a "wolfpack" made things repetitive. Now you need to scout the formation so you don't miss a target.*
    - Modified probabilities of mission types. Insertion and Land Strike are less likely. Enemy Landing Force and ASUW Strike upped to compensate.
