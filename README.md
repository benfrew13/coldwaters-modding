# coldwaters-modding
Minor tweaks to suit my preferences.

## Installing

Just to use the mod, download the zip and extract the contents to this directory in your Cold Waters install folder.

    ColdWaters_Data/StreamingAssets/override

If you're going to be working on the mod, cd into the `StreamingAssets` directory and clone the repo.
Rename the resulting `coldwaters-modding` folder to `override`.
