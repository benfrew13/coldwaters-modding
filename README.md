# coldwaters-modding
Minor tweaks to suit my preferences.

## Installing

Just to use the mod, download the zip and extract the contents to this directory in your Cold Waters install folder.

If you're going to be working on the mod, cd into the `StreamingAssets` directory and clone the repo.
Rename the resulting `coldwaters-modding` folder to `override`.

## Changes

* Changed the default controls to my preferred layout.
    - W/X for planes up/down. *More consistent IMO with Q/Z and E/C.*
    - S for level out. *Nice and central.*
    - Shift-F for noisemaker. *Too easy to accidentally hit Shift-D.*
    - Numpad 8/2 for torpedo up/down *Consistent with W/X.*
* Changed the hud layout to have all controls visible above the mini map.
* Don't load videos on the menu. *They always hitched a bit at the beginning for me, and I'd rather just get into the game that much faster.*
* Made the later Los Angeles class variants available in the 1984 campaign. *It's kinda cheating I know, but I really like having VLS.*
* Removed TLAMs from default Los Angeles Flt 3 and Seawolf loadouts. *They're useless in combat, you always have enough time to return to base when given a land strike, and I think having 8 of them makes the game think you have enough weapons and not give you the return to base prompt when it otherwise would.*
* Weapons
    - Added straight & snake search patterns to both the normal Mk 48 and ADCAP. *Even if it's not reflective of reality, having both available is useful sometimes.*
* Modified Difficulty Settings.
    - Campaign: Easy and Normal are now basically identical, with Hard and Elite being slightly more difficult. *I found the Easy campaign to be too short to be interesting, but didn't like the reload and time in port penalties applied on harder difficulties.*
    - Combat: Enemy ships now get more hull points across the board, and the player gets less on Easy and Normal. *Having a single harpoon take out almost any surface ship made Tomahawks useless. Likewise for every sub besides the Typhoon being a one-hit-kill.*
    - Combat: Slightly upped player TMA values. *You're the elite of the US Navy, your crew should be good at this. Would rather make enemy quieter to balance as needed.*
* WIP: 1989 Campaign.
    - Essentially the 1984 campaign with some tweaks.
    - Added Los Angeles flt 2/3 and Seawolf.
    - Increased possible count of SSGNs and SSBNs in their respective missions. *Knowing there would always just be one target ship in a "wolfpack" made things repetitive. Now you need to scout the formation so you don't miss a target.*
    - Modified probabilities of mission types. Insertion and Land Strike are less likely. Enemy Landing Force and ASUW Strike upped to compensate.
    - Change of an SSBN lurking somewhere around Murmansk, if you're feeling daring after an insertion or land strike.
